Google Reader and Twitter are the two sources of information I check every day. I scan through all the news items and star interesting articles in Google Reader or mark them as favorites with my Twitter client.

Sometimes I have time to read articles during the day but this usually happens in the evening.

I do this by using [Pinboard][]. Pinboard is bookmarking website with a clean and simplistic design.

The hidden gem of Pinboard is the auto-import feature. Items from Google Reader, Twitter or Instapaper can be automatically saved as bookmarks.

That way my starred items from Google Reader and my Twitter favorites are already in my bookmark list when I have time to read articles in the evening.

No website stays around forever. I want to have a copy of all important information on my local disk. 

The list of bookmarks in Pinboard can be exported to a HTML file. Articles that I want to archive are either converted to plain text with [html2txt][] or saved in [Evernote][].
